## Lab Objectives
To understand and apply different types of loops (for, while, and do-while) for solving real-world programming problems.
To develop logical thinking by implementing condition-based and iteration-controlled loops in C programs.
To practice handling user input, sentinel values, and exit-controlled conditions effectively.
To strengthen problem-solving skills through practical scenarios like attendance systems, calculators, games, and monitoring systems.
To learn how to perform calculations, counting, and classification using loops and conditional statements.
To enhance understanding of program flow control and repeated execution of code blocks.
To build confidence in writing structured, readable, and efficient C programs for basic applications.
